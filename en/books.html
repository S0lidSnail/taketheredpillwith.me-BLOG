                <h2>Buddhist Boot Camp - Timber Hawkeye</h2>
                <p>A book that is very close to my heart, due to the point in time I encountered it. One might say it is my personal Bible. It consists of many, small, self-contained chapters, which (I think) offer a refreshingly different take on things.
                    Well suited for a short read before bed or if you are stuck in a depression induced low.</p>

                <h2>Mastery - Robert Greene</h2>
                <p>We sometimes succumb to the misconception that things are difficult for us, other people just seem to fall into. But is that so? In this book, the author talks about the ups and downs of some great people of our time and the "more recent"
                    history. An excellent choice if you feel like giving up (on your dreams) because the anticipated progress is not kicking in or we are under the impression that we are moving in circles.</p>

                <h2>Siddhartha - Hermann Hesse</h2>
                <p>A lovely story about a young man trying to figure out what his life is supposed to be about. One of those German classics they make us read at school when we are way to young to appreciate them.</p>
