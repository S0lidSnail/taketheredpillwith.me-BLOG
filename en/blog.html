                <p>So, I hadn't killed myself and as a result of this I started to ask myself: Can I lead a life worth living and if so how?</p>
                <p>Psychologists, authors and coaches seem to agree, that daily structure is a crucial point in terms of betterment, on the subject of depression. So, not unlike my timetable from back in the day when I was at school, I put together a list
                    and applied some structure to my days. A lot of adjustments have been made in the past two and a half years and I still believe there to be more room for future ones. Small side note: I have been better ever since. Before we take a
                    closer look at what I came up with, let's have a glimpse at my approximate daily routine when I was at my lowest point and find out (at least partially) how it could get this far: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Sleep until it's time to go to work. </li>

                    <li> Work (meh) </li>

                    <li> Consumption of pornography and video games </li>

                    <li> Repeat! </li>
                </ul>
                <p> I don't think video games are fundamentally bad, they taught me English after all. Pornography probably is, but I haven't investigated thoroughly, hence the word "probably"! As with many things used recreationally, it is important to recognize
                    whether you are in control or whether they control you. For years the latter was the case with me, which meant that in many ways I made no progress (at all). </p>
                <p> I secretly think we know what's good for us and what's not. We just don't want to admit that habit x is a problem, we got used to it, started to identify with it. If we can admit it to ourselves however, there is another hurdle: To abandon
                    such behaviour, which we have often practiced for months or even years, and to fill it with something that suits us, maybe even brings us actual joy. In my attempt to explain why this seems to us like an insurmountable obstacle, I
                    have to go on a tangent real quick.</p>
                <p> We live in a time where we can get everything right away. Ordered stuff on Amazon? The next day the parcel carrier rings! Would you like a film? Netflix knows all the movies and at all times. Bored? There's a computer in your Pocket which
                    can provide novelty at the click of a button, whenever you feel like it. The subject of dopamine addiction, however, deserves its own entry. </p>
                <p> We are conditioned to want everything right away, which can be a problem when trying to replace an old, "bad" habit with a new, "good" one. Change does not occur immediately, but takes time. Well, that's exactly what I don't have! I want
                    my happiness(/instant gratification) now! And I can have it now, see there is one of those red dots next to the Facebook app-icon on my phone, let me just take a look ... </p>
                <p> ... sorry I'm back! I just had to look at a thing. Where was I? Oh yes, the change does not occur immediately and I can only have my pleasure stimulus later, like in that scientific study with the children and the marshmallows, which I
                    might come back to in a later post, if I have figured out how to put together a fold-out button for the sources by then. Well, I cannot be happy right now because I am learning something new, which I suck at, it is only logical that
                    I suck at it because I have never done it before. Concentration diminishes and suddenly there is this voice in your head: “Of course this wasn´t gonna work out! You are such a no good! I told you before:  It's a stupid idea. It just doesn't lead to anything!
                    You have been practicing ukulele for 30 minutes now and cannot even play "Somewhere over the Rainbow"! Why don't we watch what's new on Youtube instead?",  this being the non-adult-rated version of her talk.</p>
                <p> The voice is a liar, that much is clear to me by now. and it is of enormous importance that we recognize when she does this to be able to respond and to reason with her: “Ah there you are again! Was nice when you just gave it a rest. It
                    may be true that I have not had any notable successes so far, but it does not have to stay that way. Einstein had nothing to show for 15 years and I'm just getting started. We both know where it will go if we engage in your suggestions!
                    Maybe we do your suggestions later?!”, or something similar. The knowledge of my abyss and what kind of a place it is motivates me immensely not to fall back into old patterns - though it happens! </p>
                <p> Pro-Tip: Don't give in to your cravings instead suggest: “Let's do it in 10 minutes!”, 10 minutes later I've often forgotten it! </p>
                <p> Now let's take a look at my new daily routine that I came up with: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Get up early </li>
                    <li> Meditation </li>
                    <li> Bodyweight exercises </li>
                    <li> Short Spanish exercise on Duolingo </li>
                    <li> Learn programming (this blog is my first project) </li>
                    <li> Go to work (unfortunately still meh, but less) </li>
                    <li> Read or program some more </li>
                    <li> Second Spanish exercise </li>
                    <li> Go to bed early </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Not gonna lie! It is often hard and on approximately 7/7 days I don't feel like doing the sport part. But on about 5/7 days I (usually) do it anyway and the voice is always there and tries to keep me away. If I have a lot of time, e.g.
                    on the weekends ,I often go out into nature and/or read a book on a topic that interests me (psychology / Stoic philosophy/ Buddhism / programming). It works really well as long as I am busy enough and focus on a (positive) activity,
                    the voice has a break and at the end of the day I feel good and hopefully have learned something new. Sure, she is silent as well when I obey the order/suggestion, but for doing so I get nothing but ridicule, mockery and everything
                    goes downhill again.</p>


                <p> Finally, a few encouraging quotes that fit the topic: </p>
